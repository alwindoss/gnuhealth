GNU Health : The Free / Libre Health and Hospital Information System
====================================================================
 
GNU HEALTH is a Free / Libre, Health and Hospital Information System
that provides the following functionality:

#. **Hospital Management Information System (HMIS)**
#. **Electronic Medical Record (EMR)**
#. **Health Information System (HIS)**
#. **Laboratory Information System (LIS)**

GNU Health combines the daily medical practice with state-of-the-art 
technology in bioinformatics and genetics. It provides a holistic approach 
to the  person, from the biological and molecular basis of disease to 
the social and environmental determinants of health.

GNU Health also manages the internal processes of a health institution, 
such as calendars, financial management, billing, stock management, 
pharmacies or laboratories (LIMS)

The **GNU Health Federation** allows to interconnect heterogeneous nodes
and build large federated health networks across a region, province
or country.
