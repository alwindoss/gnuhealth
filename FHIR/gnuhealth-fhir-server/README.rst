THE GNU HEALTH FHIR SERVER
==========================

The GNU Health Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) server allows 
to query different resources from a running GNU Health HMIS node.

The GH FHIR server runs in Python3 and GNU Health HMIS node 3.6 or higher, 
and is the continuation of the excellent work done by our colleague 
Dr. Chris Zimmerman.


Installation
------------

The GNU Health FHIR server is pip installable

The server requires Flask and a few of its addons. And, of course, a working 
GNU Health HMIS instance. 

  $ pip3 install --upgrade --user gnuhealth-fhir-server


Configuration
-------------

The server ships with a simple production config file (server/config.py). However, 
it needs to be edited.::

 TRYTON_DATABASE = ''    # GNU Health database
 SERVER_NAME = ''        # Domain name of the server (e.g., fhir.example.com)
 SECRET_KEY = ''         # Set this value to a long and random string


Security
--------

Use TLS. Sensitive medical information must be protected and confidential.

By default, all FHIR endpoints except the Conformance statement require user 
authentication. The user authentication and access follows Tryton's model, 
respecting model and field access rights.

The same credentials used to sign into GNU Health are used to access the 
FHIR REST server.


Running the server
------------------

For development, you can just run the fhir_server python program.

For production environments, you should run it from a WSGI container,
such as gunicorn, uWSGI or Tornado.

* *server_tornado*: Runs the GNUHealth FHIR server behind tornado
* *server_gunicorn*: Runs the GNUHealth FHIR server behind tornado

The *log* file will be stored at the user's home directory, with the name
"fhir_server.log".

Technology
----------
The GNU Health HMIS FHIR server is built on Flask technology 
(http://flask.pocoo.org/) .

- `Flask-WTF <https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_


Development
-----------
The development of GNU Health is on GNU Savannah, using the Mercurial repository.

Tasks, bugs and mailing lists will be on health-dev@gnu.org , for development.

General discussion is done at health@gnu.org mailing list.
