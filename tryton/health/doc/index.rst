Need help to implement GNU Health ? 
-----------------------------------

We are committed to do our best in helping out projects that can improve
the health of your country or region. We want the project to be a success,
and since our resources are limited, we need to work together to make a great
and sustainable project.

In order to be elegible, we need the following information from you,
your NGO or government:

    * An introduction of the current needs
    * The project will use free software, both at the server and workstations
    * There will be a local designated person that will be in charge of
        the project and the know-how transfer to the rest of the community.
        This person must be committed to be from the beginning of the
        project until two years after its completion.
    * There must be a commitment of knowledge transfer to the rest of the team.

We will do our best to help you out with the implementation and training
for the local team, to build local capacity and make your project sustainable.

Please send us a mail with that info to info@gnuhealth.org and
we'll back to you as soon as possible.



Thank you !
