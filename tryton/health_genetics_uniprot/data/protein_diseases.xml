	<field name="description">A primary amyloidosis characterized by localized cutaneous amyloid deposition. This condition usually presents with itching (especially on the lower legs) and visible changes of skin hyperpigmentation and thickening that may be exacerbated by chronic scratching and rubbing. Primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis is often divided into macular and lichen subtypes although many affected individuals often show both variants coexisting. Lichen amyloidosis characteristically presents as a pruritic eruption of grouped hyperkeratotic papules with a predilection for the shins, calves, ankles and dorsa of feet and thighs. Papules may coalesce to form hyperkeratotic plaques that can resemble lichen planus, lichen simplex or nodular prurigo. Macular amyloidosis is characterized by small pigmented macules that may merge to produce macular hyperpigmentation, sometimes with a reticulate or rippled pattern. In macular and lichen amyloidosis, amyloid is deposited in the papillary dermis in association with grouped colloid bodies, thought to represent degenerate basal keratinocytes. The amyloid deposits probably reflect a combination of degenerate keratin filaments, serum amyloid P component, and deposition of immunoglobulins.</field>

The pelvic girdle is affected first, then the shoulder girdle. Progression is steady and most patients are confined to a wheelchair by age of 10 or 12. Flexion contractures and scoliosis ultimately occur. About 50% of patients have a lower IQ than their genetic expectations would suggest. There is no treatment.</field>

	<field name="description">A dominant demyelinating form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a disorder of the peripheral nervous system, characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy, initially of the peroneal muscles and later of the distal muscles of the arms. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is classified in two main groups on the basis of electrophysiologic properties and histopathology: primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies (designated CMT1 when they are dominantly inherited) and primary peripheral axonal neuropathies (CMT2). Demyelinating neuropathies are characterized by severely reduced nerve conduction velocities (less than 38 m/sec), segmental demyelination and remyelination with onion bulb formations on nerve biopsy, slowly progressive distal muscle atrophy and weakness, absent deep tendon reflexes, and hollow feet.</field>

There is delayed neural development and severe progressive neurologic degeneration resulting in mental retardation. Two clinical forms are recognized: in the classical form or Cockayne syndrome type 1, the symptoms are progressive and typically become apparent within the first few years or life; the less common Cockayne syndrome type 2 is characterized by more severe symptoms that manifest prenatally. Cockayne syndrome shows some overlap with certain forms of xeroderma pigmentosum. Unlike xeroderma pigmentosum, patients with Cockayne syndrome do not manifest increased freckling and other pigmentation abnormalities in the skin and have no significant increase in skin cancer.</field>

LCATD is generally referred to the complete form which is associated with absence of both alpha and beta LCAT activities resulting in esterification anomalies involving both HDL (alpha-LCAT activity) and LDL (beta-LCAT activity). It causes a typical triad of diffuse corneal opacities, target cell hemolytic anemia, and proteinuria with renal failure.</field>

It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected.</field>

Radiological examination of the skeleton shows delayed, irregular mineralization of the epiphyseal ossification centers and of the centers of the carpal and tarsal bones. Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia is broadly categorized into the more severe Fairbank and the milder Ribbing types. The Fairbank type is characterized by shortness of stature, short and stubby fingers, small epiphyses in several joints, including the knee, ankle, hand, and hip. The Ribbing type is confined predominantly to the hip joints and is characterized by hands that are normal and stature that is normal or near-normal. Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia type 5 is relatively mild and clinically variable. It is primarily characterized by delayed and irregular ossification of the epiphyses and early-onset osteoarthritis.</field>

	<field name="description">A disorder of the retinal vasculature characterized by an abrupt cessation of growth of peripheral capillaries, leading to an avascular peripheral retina. This may lead to compensatory retinal neovascularization, which is thought to be induced by hypoxia from the initial avascular insult. New vessels are prone to leakage and rupture causing exudates and bleeding, followed by scarring, retinal detachment and blindness. Clinical features can be highly variable, even within the same family. Patients with mild forms of the disease are asymptomatic, and their only disease related abnormality is an arc of avascular retina in the extreme temporal periphery. In many ways the disease resembles retinopathy of prematurity but there is no evidence of prematurity or small birth weight in the patient history.</field>

Pituitary adenomas are clinically classified as functional and non-functional tumors, and manifest with a variety of features, including local invasion of surrounding structures and excessive hormone secretion. Functional pituitary adenomas are further classified by the type of hormone they secrete. PITA4 results in excessive production of adrenocorticotropic hormone. This leads to hypersecretion of cortisol by the adrenal glands and ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome. Clinical manifestations of Cushing syndrome include facial and truncal obesity, abdominal striae, muscular weakness, osteoporosis, arterial hypertension, diabetes.</field>

Anosmia or hyposmia is related to the absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs and tracts. Hypogonadism is due to deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone and probably results from a failure of embryonic migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. In the presence of anosmia, idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as Kallmann syndrome, whereas in the presence of a normal sense of smell, it has been termed normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH).</field>

Cerulean cataract is characterized by peripheral bluish and white opacifications organized in concentric layers with occasional central lesions arranged radially. The opacities are observed in the superficial layers of the fetal nucleus as well as the adult nucleus of the lens. Involvement is usually bilateral. Visual acuity is only mildly reduced in childhood. In adulthood, the opacifications may progress, making lens extraction necessary. Histologically the lesions are described as fusiform cavities between lens fibers which contain a deeply staining granular material. Although the lesions may take on various colors, a dull blue is the most common appearance and is responsible for the designation cerulean cataract. Sutural cataract with punctate and cerulean opacities is characterized by white opacification around the anterior and posterior Y sutures, and grayish and bluish, spindle shaped, oval punctate and cerulean opacities of various sizes arranged in lamellar form. The spots are more concentrated towards the peripheral layers and do not delineate the embryonal or fetal nucleus.

Pulverulent cataracts are characterized by a dust-like, 'pulverised' appearance of the opacities which can be found in any part of the lens. In some cases cataract is associated with microcornea without any other systemic anomaly or dysmorphism. Microcornea is defined by a corneal diameter inferior to 10 mm in both meridians in an otherwise normal eye.</field>

An almost total lack of LCT activity is found in jejunal biopsy material of patients with congenital lactase deficiency. Opposite to congenital lactase deficiency, also known as lactose intolerance, is the most common enzyme deficiency worldwide. It is caused by developmental down-regulation of lactase activity during childhood or early adulthood. The decline of lactase activity is a normal physiological phenomenon; however, the majority of Northern Europeans have the ability to maintain lactase activity and digest lactose throughout life (lactase persistence). The down-regulation of lactase activity operates at the transcriptional level and it is associated with a noncoding variation in the MCM6 gene, located in the upstream vicinity of LCT.</field>

	<field name="description">A form of anterior segment dysgenesis, a group of defects affecting anterior structures of the eye including cornea, iris, lens, trabecular meshwork, and Schlemm canal. Anterior segment dysgeneses result from abnormal migration or differentiation of the neural crest derived mesenchymal cells that give rise to components of the anterior chamber during eye development. Different anterior segment anomalies may exist alone or in combination, including iris hypoplasia, enlarged or reduced corneal diameter, corneal vascularization and opacity, posterior embryotoxon, corectopia, polycoria, abnormal iridocorneal angle, ectopia lentis, and anterior synechiae between the iris and posterior corneal surface. Clinical conditions falling within the phenotypic spectrum of anterior segment dysgeneses include aniridia, Axenfeld anomaly, Reiger anomaly/syndrome, Peters anomaly, and iridogoniodysgenesis. Some ASGD2 patients show congenital primary aphakia, a defect caused by eye development arrest around the 4th-5th week of gestation. This prevents the formation of any lens structure and leads to severe secondary ocular anomalies, including a complete aplasia of the anterior segment of the eye. In contrast, in secondary aphakic eyes, lens induction has occurred, and the lens vesicle has developed to some degree but finally has progressively resorbed perinatally, leading, therefore, to less severe ocular defects. ASGD2 inheritance is autosomal recessive.</field>

Epidemiologic studies have failed to implicate the ingestion of infected animal meat in the pathogenesis of CJD in human. The triad of microscopic features that characterize the prion diseases consists of (1) spongiform degeneration of neurons, (2) severe astrocytic gliosis that often appears to be out of proportion to the degree of nerve cell loss, and (3) amyloid plaque formation. CJD is characterized by progressive dementia and myoclonic seizures, affecting adults in mid-life. Some patients present sleep disorders, abnormalities of high cortical function, cerebellar and corticospinal disturbances. The disease ends in death after a 3-12 months illness.</field>

Opacities vary in morphology, are often confined to a portion of the lens, and may be static or progressive. CTRCT4 includes crystalline aculeiform, congenital cerulean and non-nuclear polymorphic cataracts, among others. Crystalline aculeiform cataract is characterized by fiberglass-like or needle-like crystals projecting in different directions, through or close to the axial region of the lens. Non-nuclear polymorphic cataract is a partial opacity with variable location between the fetal nucleus of the lens and the equator. The fetal nucleus is normal. The opacities are irregular and look similar to a bunch of grapes and may be present simultaneously in different lens layers. Congenital cerulean cataract is characterized by peripheral bluish and white opacifications organized in concentric layers with occasional central lesions arranged radially. The opacities are observed in the superficial layers of the fetal nucleus as well as the adult nucleus of the lens. Involvement is usually bilateral. Visual acuity is only mildly reduced in childhood. In adulthood, the opacifications may progress, making lens extraction necessary. Histologically the lesions are described as fusiform cavities between lens fibers which contain a deeply staining granular material. Although the lesions may take on various colors, a dull blue is the most common appearance and is responsible for the designation cerulean cataract.</field>

Alzheimer disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive dementia, loss of cognitive abilities, and deposition of fibrillar amyloid proteins as intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, extracellular amyloid plaques and vascular amyloid deposits. The major constituents of these plaques are neurotoxic amyloid-beta protein 40 and amyloid-beta protein 42, that are produced by the proteolysis of the transmembrane APP protein. The cytotoxic C-terminal fragments (CTFs) and the caspase-cleaved products, such as C31, are also implicated in neuronal death.</field>

Patients experience frequent bone fractures caused by trivial accidents in childhood; however the fractures heal normally without bone deformity. The jaw lesions replace the tooth-bearing segments of the maxilla and mandible with fibrous connective tissues, including various amounts of cementum-like calcified mass, sometimes causing facial deformities. Patients also have a propensity for jaw infection and often suffer from purulent osteomyelitis-like symptoms, such as swelling of and pus discharge from the gums, mobility of the teeth, insufficient healing after tooth extraction and exposure of the lesions into the oral cavity.</field>

FHC features include joint deformities, sensorineural hearing loss, and subsequent development of generalized lymphadenopathy and swellings in the eyelids that contain histiocytes. SHML causes lymph node enlargement in children frequently accompanied by fever, leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. H syndrome is characterized by cutaneous hyperpigmentation and hypertrichosis, hepatosplenomegaly, heart anomalies, and hypogonadism; hearing loss is found in about half of patients.

	<field name="description">EXT is a genetically heterogeneous bone disorder caused by genes segregating on human chromosomes 8, 11, and 19 and designated EXT1, EXT2 and EXT3 respectively. EXT is a dominantly inherited skeletal disorder primarily affecting endochondral bone during growth. The disease is characterized by formation of numerous cartilage-capped, benign bone tumors (osteocartilaginous exostoses or osteochondromas) that are often accompanied by skeletal deformities and short stature. In a small percentage of cases exostoses have exhibited malignant transformation resulting in an osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma. Osteochondromas development can also occur as a sporadic event.</field>

Onset occurs in the first decade, usually between ages 5 and 9. Painful attacks with photophobia, foreign body sensations, and recurrent erosions occur in most patients. The disease is due to deposition of an unsulfated keratan sulfate both within the intracellular space (within the keratocytes and endothelial cells) and in the extracellular corneal stroma. Macular corneal dystrophy is divided into the clinically indistinguishable types I, IA, and II based on analysis of the normally sulfated, or antigenic, keratan sulfate levels in serum and immunohistochemical evaluation of the cornea. Patients with types I and IA macular corneal dystrophy have undetectable serum levels of antigenic keratan sulfate, whereas those with type II macular corneal dystrophy have normal or low levels, depending on the population examined.</field>

This phenotype is caused by inadequate testicular synthesis of testosterone, which, in turn, results in insufficient formation of dihydrotestosterone in the anlage of the external genitalia and prostate during fetal development. At the expected time of puberty, there is a marked increase in plasma leuteinizing hormone and, consequently, in testicular secretion of androstenedione. Hence, a diagnostic hallmark of this disorder is a decreased plasma testosterone-to-androstenedione ratio. Significant amounts of the circulating androstenedione are, however, converted to testosterone, in peripheral tissues, thereby causing virilization.</field>

Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes.

Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers.</field>

This may lead to compensatory retinal neovascularization, which is thought to be induced by hypoxia from the initial avascular insult. New vessels are prone to leakage and rupture causing exudates and bleeding, followed by scarring, retinal detachment and blindness. Clinical features can be highly variable, even within the same family. Patients with mild forms of the disease are asymptomatic, and their only disease related abnormality is an arc of avascular retina in the extreme temporal periphery. In many ways the disease resembles retinopathy of prematurity but there is no evidence of prematurity or small birth weight in the patient history.</field>

Type 1 sialidosis (cherry red spot-myoclonus syndrome or normosomatic type) is late-onset and it is characterized by the formation of cherry red macular spots in childhood, progressive debilitating myoclonus, insiduous visual loss and rarely ataxia. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the screening of the urine for sialyloligosaccharides. Type 2 sialidosis (also known as dysmorphic type) occurs as several variants of increasing severity with earlier age of onset. It is characterized by the presence of abnormal somatic features including coarse facies and dysostosis multiplex, vertebral deformities, mental retardation, cherry-red spot/myoclonus, sialuria, cytoplasmic vacuolation of peripheral lymphocytes, bone marrow cells and conjunctival epithelial cells.</field>

The opacity may be so dense as to render the entire central region of the lens completely opaque, or so translucent that vision is hardly if at all impeded. Zonular cataracts generally do not involve the embryonic nucleus, though sometimes they involve the fetal nucleus. Usually sharply separated from a clear cortex outside them, they may have projections from their outer edges known as riders or spokes. In some cases cataract is associated with microcornea without any other systemic anomaly or dysmorphism. Microcornea is defined by a corneal diameter inferior to 10 mm in both meridians in an otherwise normal eye.</field>

	<field name="description">A form of orofaciodigital syndrome, a group of heterogeneous disorders characterized by abnormalities in the oral cavity, face, and digits and associated phenotypic abnormalities that lead to the delineation of various subtypes. OFD1 is X-linked dominant syndrome, lethal in males. Craniofacial findings consist of facial asymmetry, hypertelorism, median cleft, or pseudocleft of the upper lip, hypoplasia of the alae nasi, oral clefts and abnormal frenulea, tongue anomalies (clefting, cysts, hamartoma), and anomalous dentition involving missing or extra teeth. Asymmetric brachydactyly and/or syndactyly of the fingers and toes occur frequently. Approximately 50% of OFD1 females have some degree of intellectual disability. Some patients have structural central nervous system anomalies such as agenesis of the corpus callosum, cerebellar agenesis, or a Dandy-Walker malformation. Patients with OFD1 can develop fibrocystic disease of the liver and pancreas, in addition to polycystic kidneys.</field>

It is clinically characterized by anchoring of the eyes in downward gaze, ptosis, and backward tilt of the head. Congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles type 3 presents as a non-progressive, autosomal dominant disorder with variable expression. Patients may be bilaterally or unilaterally affected, and their oculo-motility defects range from complete ophthalmoplegia (with the eyes fixed in a hypo- and exotropic position), to mild asymptomatic restrictions of ocular movement. Ptosis, refractive error, amblyopia, and compensatory head positions are associated with the more severe forms of the disorder. In some cases, the ocular phenotype is accompanied by additional features including developmental delay, corpus callosum agenesis, basal ganglia dysmorphism, facial weakness, polyneuropathy.</field>

It lacks malignant epithelial elements, a feature that distinguishes it from the classic adult-type pulmonary blastoma. It arises during fetal lung development and is often part of an inherited cancer syndrome. The tumor contain both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Early in tumorigenesis, cysts form in lung airspaces, and these cysts are lined with benign-appearing epithelium. Mesenchymal cells susceptible to malignant transformation reside within the cyst walls and form a dense layer beneath the epithelial lining. In a subset of patients, overgrowth of the mesenchymal cells produces a sarcoma, a transition that is associated with a poorer prognosis. Some patients have multilocular cystic nephroma, a benign kidney tumor.</field>

Another skin manifestation is pachyonychia, but alopecia and leukoplakia are distinctively absent. Patients have recurrent pneumonias that usually result in reactive airway disease and/or chronic cough. One of the most important extracutaneous symptoms is an increased susceptibility to infections, mainly affecting the respiratory system, primarily due to a chronic neutropenia and to neutrophil functional defects. Bone marrow abnormalities account for neutropenia and may evolve into myelodysplasia associated with the risk of leukemic transformation.

Joint pain, joint deformity, waddling gait, and short stature are the main clinical signs and symptoms. Radiological examination of the skeleton shows delayed, irregular mineralization of the epiphyseal ossification centers and of the centers of the carpal and tarsal bones. Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia is broadly categorized into the more severe Fairbank and the milder Ribbing types. The Fairbank type is characterized by shortness of stature, short and stubby fingers, small epiphyses in several joints, including the knee, ankle, hand, and hip. The Ribbing type is confined predominantly to the hip joints and is characterized by hands that are normal and stature that is normal or near-normal. Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia type 5 is relatively mild and clinically variable. It is primarily characterized by delayed and irregular ossification of the epiphyses and early-onset osteoarthritis.</field>

It is characterized by predisposition to illness caused by moderately virulent mycobacterial species, such as Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, environmental non-tuberculous mycobacteria, and by the more virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Other microorganisms rarely cause severe clinical disease in individuals with susceptibility to mycobacterial infections, with the exception of Salmonella which infects less than 50% of these individuals. Clinical outcome severity depends on the degree of impairment of interferon-gamma mediated immunity. Some patients die of overwhelming mycobacterial disease with lepromatous-like lesions in early childhood, whereas others develop, later in life, disseminated but curable infections with tuberculoid granulomas. IMD29 is characterized by undetectable IL12B secretion from leukocytes.

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is classified in two main groups on the basis of electrophysiologic properties and histopathology: primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies (designated CMT1 when they are dominantly inherited) and primary peripheral axonal neuropathies (CMT2). Neuropathies of the CMT2 group are characterized by signs of axonal degeneration in the absence of obvious myelin alterations, normal or slightly reduced nerve conduction velocities, and progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy.</field>

SCA2 belongs to the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias type I (ADCA I) which are characterized by cerebellar ataxia in combination with additional clinical features like optic atrophy, ophthalmoplegia, bulbar and extrapyramidal signs, peripheral neuropathy and dementia. SCA2 is characterized by hyporeflexia, myoclonus and action tremor and dopamine-responsive parkinsonism. In some patients, SCA2 presents as pure familial parkinsonism without cerebellar signs.</field>

Demyelinating neuropathies are characterized by severely reduced nerve conduction velocities (less than 38 m/sec), segmental demyelination and remyelination with onion bulb formations on nerve biopsy, slowly progressive distal muscle atrophy and weakness, absent deep tendon reflexes, and hollow feet. By convention autosomal recessive forms of demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are designated CMT4.

Most patients have spontaneous remission by 12 months of age and show normal psychomotor development. Some rare cases manifest an atypical severe phenotype associated with epileptic encephalopathy and psychomotor retardation. The disorder is distinguished from benign familial infantile seizures by an earlier age at onset. In some patients, neonatal convulsions are followed later in life by myokymia, a benign condition characterized by spontaneous involuntary contractions of skeletal muscles fiber groups that can be observed as vermiform movement of the overlying skin. Electromyography typically shows continuous motor unit activity with spontaneous oligo- and multiplet-discharges of high intraburst frequency (myokymic discharges).

	<field name="description">A rare pediatric intrathoracic neoplasm. The tumor arises from the lung, pleura, or both, and appears to be purely mesenchymal in phenotype. It lacks malignant epithelial elements, a feature that distinguishes it from the classic adult-type pulmonary blastoma. It arises during fetal lung development and is often part of an inherited cancer syndrome. The tumor contain both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Early in tumorigenesis, cysts form in lung airspaces, and these cysts are lined with benign-appearing epithelium. Mesenchymal cells susceptible to malignant transformation reside within the cyst walls and form a dense layer beneath the epithelial lining. In a subset of patients, overgrowth of the mesenchymal cells produces a sarcoma, a transition that is associated with a poorer prognosis. Some patients have multilocular cystic nephroma, a benign kidney tumor.</field>

This condition usually presents with itching (especially on the lower legs) and visible changes of skin hyperpigmentation and thickening that may be exacerbated by chronic scratching and rubbing. Primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis is often divided into macular and lichen subtypes although many affected individuals often show both variants coexisting. Lichen amyloidosis characteristically presents as a pruritic eruption of grouped hyperkeratotic papules with a predilection for the shins, calves, ankles and dorsa of feet and thighs. Papules may coalesce to form hyperkeratotic plaques that can resemble lichen planus, lichen simplex or nodular prurigo. Macular amyloidosis is characterized by small pigmented macules that may merge to produce macular hyperpigmentation, sometimes with a reticulate or rippled pattern. In macular and lichen amyloidosis, amyloid is deposited in the papillary dermis in association with grouped colloid bodies, thought to represent degenerate basal keratinocytes. The amyloid deposits probably reflect a combination of degenerate keratin filaments, serum amyloid P component, and deposition of immunoglobulins.</field>

Microcephaly ranges from mild to severe and is often associated with mild to moderate developmental delay and a characteristic facial phenotype with upslanting palpebral fissures, broad nose with rounded tip, long philtrum with thin upper lip, prominent chin, and prominent ears. Chorioretinopathy is the most common eye abnormality, but retinal folds, microphthalmia, and myopic and hypermetropic astigmatism have also been reported, and some individuals have no overt ocular phenotype. Congenital lymphedema, when present, is typically confined to the dorsa of the feet, and lymphoscintigraphy reveals the absence of radioactive isotope uptake from the webspaces between the toes.</field>

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is classified in two main groups on the basis of electrophysiologic properties and histopathology: primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies (designated CMT1 when they are dominantly inherited) and primary peripheral axonal neuropathies (CMT2). Neuropathies of the CMT2 group are characterized by signs of axonal degeneration in the absence of obvious myelin alterations, normal or slightly reduced nerve conduction velocities, and progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy.</field>

	<field name="description">A form of acrofacial dysostosis, a group of disorders which are characterized by malformation of the craniofacial skeleton and the limbs. The major facial features of AFD1 include downslanted palpebral fissures, midface retrusion, and micrognathia, the latter of which often requires the placement of a tracheostomy in early childhood. Limb defects typically involve the anterior (radial) elements of the upper limbs and manifest as small or absent thumbs, triphalangeal thumbs, radial hyoplasia or aplasia, and radioulnar synostosis. Phocomelia of the upper limbs and, occasionally, lower-limb defects have also been reported.</field>

	<field name="description">A form of short-rib thoracic dysplasia, a group of autosomal recessive ciliopathies that are characterized by a constricted thoracic cage, short ribs, shortened tubular bones, and a 'trident' appearance of the acetabular roof. Polydactyly is variably present. Non-skeletal involvement can include cleft lip/palate as well as anomalies of major organs such as the brain, eye, heart, kidneys, liver, pancreas, intestines, and genitalia. Some forms of the disease are lethal in the neonatal period due to respiratory insufficiency secondary to a severely restricted thoracic cage, whereas others are compatible with life. Disease spectrum encompasses Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (Jeune syndrome), Mainzer-Saldino syndrome, and short rib-polydactyly syndrome. SRTD9 is characterized by phalangeal cone-shaped epiphyses, chronic renal disease, nearly constant retinal dystrophy, and mild radiographic abnormality of the proximal femur. Occasional features include short stature, cerebellar ataxia, and hepatic fibrosis.</field>

	<field name="description">A syndrome characterized by severely short long bones, peculiar facies associated with paucity of hair, and nail anomalies. Growth retardation is evident on prenatal ultrasound as early as the second trimester of pregnancy, and affected individuals reach a final stature consistent with a height age of 6 years to 8 years. Relative macrocephaly is present during early childhood but head circumference is markedly low by adulthood. Psychomotor development is normal. Facial dysmorphism includes a long, triangular face with prominent nose and small ears, and affected individuals have an unusual high-pitched voice. Clinodactyly, brachydactyly, and hypoplastic distal phalanges and fingernails are present in association with postpubertal sparse and short hair. Typical skeletal findings include short and thick long bones with mild irregular metaphyseal changes, short femoral necks, and hypoplastic pelvis and sacrum. All long bones of the hand are short, with major delay of carpal ossification and cone-shaped epiphyses. Vertebral body ossification is also delayed.</field>

Aplasia cutis congenita can be located anywhere on the body, but in the vast majority of the cases, it is present on the posterior parietal region where it is often associated with an underlying defect of the parietal bones. Limb abnormalities are typically limb truncation defects affecting the distal phalanges or entire digits (true ectrodactyly). Only rarely, metatarsals/metacarpals or more proximal limb structures are also affected. Apart from transverse limb defects, syndactyly, most commonly of second and third toes, can also be observed. The clinical features are highly variable and can also include cardiovascular malformations, brain abnormalities and vascular defects such as cutis marmorata and dilated scalp veins. AOS3 patients manifest characteristic vertex scalp defects and terminal limb defects, but without congenital heart defects, other associated defects, or immune defects.</field>

	<field name="description">An autosomal recessive form of primary dyskinesia, a disorder characterized by abnormalities of motile cilia. Respiratory infections leading to chronic inflammation and bronchiectasis are recurrent, due to defects in the respiratory cilia; reduced fertility is often observed in male patients due to abnormalities of sperm tails. Half of the patients exhibit randomization of left-right body asymmetry and situs inversus, due to dysfunction of monocilia at the embryonic node. Primary ciliary dyskinesia associated with situs inversus is referred to as Kartagener syndrome. CILD5 is characterized by early onset of a progressive decline in lung function due to an inability to clear mucus and particles from the airways. Affected individuals have recurrent infections of the sinuses, ears, airways, and lungs. Sperm motility is also decreased. Individuals with CILD5 do not have situs inversus.</field>

Distal hereditary motor neuronopathies constitute a heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders caused by selective degeneration of motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, without sensory deficit in the posterior horn. The overall clinical picture consists of a classical distal muscular atrophy syndrome in the legs without clinical sensory loss. The disease starts with weakness and wasting of distal muscles of the anterior tibial and peroneal compartments of the legs. Later on, weakness and atrophy may expand to the proximal muscles of the lower limbs and/or to the distal upper limbs. HMN7A is characterized by onset in the second decade of progressive distal muscle wasting and weakness affecting the upper and lower limbs and resulting in walking difficulties and hand grip. There is significant muscle atrophy of the hands and lower limbs. The disorder is associated with vocal cord paresis due to involvement of the tenth cranial nerve.</field>

Clinical features include mental and physical retardation, feeding problems, and a maple syrup odor to the urine. The keto acids of the branched-chain amino acids are present in the urine. If untreated, maple syrup urine disease can lead to seizures, coma, and death. The disease is often classified by its pattern of signs and symptoms. The most common and severe form of the disease is the classic type, which becomes apparent soon after birth. Variant forms of the disorder become apparent later in infancy or childhood and are typically milder, but they still involve developmental delay and other medical problems if not treated. MSUDMV is characterized by increased plasma levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) apparent at birth.

	<field name="description">An autosomal dominant hemolytic anemia characterized by primary erythrocyte dehydration. DHS erythrocytes exhibit decreased total cation and potassium content that are not accompanied by a proportional net gain of sodium and water. DHS patients typically exhibit mild to moderate compensated hemolytic anemia, with an increased erythrocyte mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and a decreased osmotic fragility, both of which reflect cellular dehydration. Patients may also show perinatal edema and pseudohyperkalemia due to loss of potassium from red cells stored at room temperature. A minor proportion of red cells appear as stomatocytes on blood films. Complications such as splenomegaly and cholelithiasis, resulting from increased red cell trapping in the spleen and elevated bilirubin levels, respectively, may occur. The course of DHS is frequently associated with iron overload, which may lead to hepatosiderosis.</field>

	<field name="description">A rare pediatric intrathoracic neoplasm. The tumor arises from the lung, pleura, or both, and appears to be purely mesenchymal in phenotype. It lacks malignant epithelial elements, a feature that distinguishes it from the classic adult-type pulmonary blastoma. It arises during fetal lung development and is often part of an inherited cancer syndrome. The tumor contain both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Early in tumorigenesis, cysts form in lung airspaces, and these cysts are lined with benign-appearing epithelium. Mesenchymal cells susceptible to malignant transformation reside within the cyst walls and form a dense layer beneath the epithelial lining. In a subset of patients, overgrowth of the mesenchymal cells produces a sarcoma, a transition that is associated with a poorer prognosis. Some patients have multilocular cystic nephroma, a benign kidney tumor.</field>

OFD1 is X-linked dominant syndrome, lethal in males. Craniofacial findings consist of facial asymmetry, hypertelorism, median cleft, or pseudocleft of the upper lip, hypoplasia of the alae nasi, oral clefts and abnormal frenulea, tongue anomalies (clefting, cysts, hamartoma), and anomalous dentition involving missing or extra teeth. Asymmetric brachydactyly and/or syndactyly of the fingers and toes occur frequently. Approximately 50% of OFD1 females have some degree of intellectual disability. Some patients have structural central nervous system anomalies such as agenesis of the corpus callosum, cerebellar agenesis, or a Dandy-Walker malformation. Patients with OFD1 can develop fibrocystic disease of the liver and pancreas, in addition to polycystic kidneys.</field>

	<field name="description">An opacification of the crystalline lens of the eye that frequently results in visual impairment or blindness. Opacities vary in morphology, are often confined to a portion of the lens, and may be static or progressive. In general, the more posteriorly located and dense an opacity, the greater the impact on visual function. CTRCT21 includes cerulean and pulverulent cataracts. Cerulean cataracts are characterized by peripheral bluish and white opacifications organized in concentric layers with occasional central lesions arranged radially. The opacities are observed in the superficial layers of the fetal nucleus as well as the adult nucleus of the lens. Involvement is usually bilateral. Visual acuity is only mildly reduced in childhood. In adulthood, the opacifications may progress, making lens extraction necessary. Histologically the lesions are described as fusiform cavities between lens fibers which contain a deeply staining granular material. Although the lesions may take on various colors, a dull blue is the most common appearance and is responsible for the designation cerulean cataract. Pulverulent cataracts are characterized by a dust-like, 'pulverised' appearance of the opacities which can be found in any part of the lens. In some cases cataract is associated with microcornea without any other systemic anomaly or dysmorphism. Microcornea is defined by a corneal diameter inferior to 10 mm in both meridians in an otherwise normal eye.</field>

Limb abnormalities are typically limb truncation defects affecting the distal phalanges or entire digits (true ectrodactyly). Only rarely, metatarsals/metacarpals or more proximal limb structures are also affected. Apart from transverse limb defects, syndactyly, most commonly of second and third toes, can also be observed.

Distal hereditary motor neuronopathies constitute a heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders caused by selective degeneration of motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, without sensory deficit in the posterior horn. The overall clinical picture consists of a classical distal muscular atrophy syndrome in the legs without clinical sensory loss. The disease starts with weakness and wasting of distal muscles of the anterior tibial and peroneal compartments of the legs. Later on, weakness and atrophy may expand to the proximal muscles of the lower limbs and/or to the distal upper limbs. HMN7A is characterized by onset in the second decade of progressive distal muscle wasting and weakness affecting the upper and lower limbs and resulting in walking difficulties and hand grip. There is significant muscle atrophy of the hands and lower limbs. The disorder is associated with vocal cord paresis due to involvement of the tenth cranial nerve.</field>

This prevents the formation of any lens structure and leads to severe secondary ocular anomalies, including a complete aplasia of the anterior segment of the eye. In contrast, in secondary aphakic eyes, lens induction has occurred, and the lens vesicle has developed to some degree but finally has progressively resorbed perinatally, leading, therefore, to less severe ocular defects. ASGD2 inheritance is autosomal recessive.</field>

	<field name="description">A form of anterior segment dysgenesis, a group of defects affecting anterior structures of the eye including cornea, iris, lens, trabecular meshwork, and Schlemm canal. Anterior segment dysgeneses result from abnormal migration or differentiation of the neural crest derived mesenchymal cells that give rise to components of the anterior chamber during eye development. Different anterior segment anomalies may exist alone or in combination, including iris hypoplasia, enlarged or reduced corneal diameter, corneal vascularization and opacity, posterior embryotoxon, corectopia, polycoria, abnormal iridocorneal angle, ectopia lentis, and anterior synechiae between the iris and posterior corneal surface. Clinical conditions falling within the phenotypic spectrum of anterior segment dysgeneses include aniridia, Axenfeld anomaly, Reiger anomaly/syndrome, Peters anomaly, and iridogoniodysgenesis. Some ASGD2 patients show congenital primary aphakia, a defect caused by eye development arrest around the 4th-5th week of gestation. This prevents the formation of any lens structure and leads to severe secondary ocular anomalies, including a complete aplasia of the anterior segment of the eye. In contrast, in secondary aphakic eyes, lens induction has occurred, and the lens vesicle has developed to some degree but finally has progressively resorbed perinatally, leading, therefore, to less severe ocular defects. ASGD2 inheritance is autosomal recessive.</field>

	<field name="description">A primary amyloidosis characterized by localized cutaneous amyloid deposition. This condition usually presents with itching (especially on the lower legs) and visible changes of skin hyperpigmentation and thickening that may be exacerbated by chronic scratching and rubbing. Primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis is often divided into macular and lichen subtypes although many affected individuals often show both variants coexisting. Lichen amyloidosis characteristically presents as a pruritic eruption of grouped hyperkeratotic papules with a predilection for the shins, calves, ankles and dorsa of feet and thighs. Papules may coalesce to form hyperkeratotic plaques that can resemble lichen planus, lichen simplex or nodular prurigo. Macular amyloidosis is characterized by small pigmented macules that may merge to produce macular hyperpigmentation, sometimes with a reticulate or rippled pattern. In macular and lichen amyloidosis, amyloid is deposited in the papillary dermis in association with grouped colloid bodies, thought to represent degenerate basal keratinocytes. The amyloid deposits probably reflect a combination of degenerate keratin filaments, serum amyloid P component, and deposition of immunoglobulins. PLCA3 inheritance is autosomal recessive.</field>
