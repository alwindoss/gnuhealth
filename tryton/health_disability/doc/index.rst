GNU Health Patient Functionality and Disability Information Module
##################################################################

The package applies the International Classification of Functionality,
Disability and Health (ICF) from the World Health Organization.

GNU Health focuses in Social Medicine, so the package health_disability
helps in assessing not only the molecular basis of the disease, 
but all the environmental barriers that a person is exposed in their
lifetime, and how they affect them from the physical, emotional and
in their integration of the society.
